# Folder Management Automation Script

This script represents the final working solution after extensive trial, error, and iterative improvements. Due to constraints of the original development environment—specifically, working directly on a company computer without access to an IDE or version control—earlier drafts, debugging processes, and iterative changes are unavailable.

However, the provided script demonstrates the end result of that careful and methodical process, effectively automating folder management tasks to streamline workflows.
